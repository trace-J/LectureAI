"""What Claude is asked for, per profile: the response schema and the prompt.

Syllabus summarizes a lecture for a student; Sous summarizes a client call for
the account team. Both return the same four keys (summary_md, topic_slug,
key_terms, action_items), so everything downstream of the model call, the
filenames, the uploaded Doc, and the Notion push, is shared. What differs is
what the model is told those keys mean.

Every field is a plain string rather than a date or an enum. The schema is
enforced server-side, and a nullable or enum-typed field is a place for that
enforcement to reject a response the pipeline could otherwise have used. An
empty string is unambiguous and normalizing in Python is free.
