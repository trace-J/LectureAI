"""A small local control panel for the pipeline.

    intake panel          # opens http://127.0.0.1:5173 in your browser

The port is the profile's: 5173 for Syllabus, 5174 for Sous, so both panels
can run at once. --port overrides it.

Start and stop a recording, see whether the watcher is running, and check on
recent lectures, without remembering any commands. It drives the same modules
the CLI does, so anything started here behaves identically to the CLI.

The Setup page (/setup) is the browser version of `intake setup`: keys,
microphone, class schedule, Notion, and the Google Drive login, writing the
same .env and schedule.toml into the home directory. The panel opens it
first when nothing is configured yet.

Bound to localhost on purpose. It can start and stop processes and read your
pipeline log, none of which should be reachable from the network.
