"""Is there a newer Syllabus? Asked of GitHub Releases once a day, answered from a file.

Releases of the app are tags like v0.2.0 on trace-J/LectureAI, cut by the
release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml). The panel asks GitHub for
the list from a thread at startup, no more than once a day, and remembers
the answer in the home directory. The status the page polls, and the menu
bar's menu, read that file and never the network, so a Mac that is offline
or a GitHub that is slow costs nothing.

What a person is told depends on how Syllabus was installed. In the app,
the newer version is a download away and the notice links to it. From a
pipx install the update is `pipx upgrade intake`, so the notice says that.
Nothing replaces itself: an unsigned app that swapped its own files would
send everyone back through Gatekeeper on each version, and its microphone
permission with them. Self-update waits for a signed build.

Other releases on the same repository, the ffmpeg builds the app bundles,
are tagged ffmpeg-... and are skipped here.
