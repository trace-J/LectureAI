"""Ask questions across the lectures already filed in Drive.

The pipeline deletes a recording once its summary and transcript are safely
uploaded, so everything the assistant can draw on lives in Drive and nowhere
on this Mac. pipeline.log is the index: one line per filed lecture, carrying
the course, the class date, the topic slug and the Doc's URL. This module
turns that index into context, asks Claude, and streams the answer back.

Two stages, because the whole cost model rests on them:

  Stage 1  Every summary for the course, as cached document blocks. A summary
           is a couple of pages; a whole course of them is still small, and
           after the first question of a session the cache serves them for a
           tenth of the price. Most questions never need more than this.

  Stage 2  Full transcripts, and only for the lectures the model actually
           names. Claude asks for them by calling the fetch_transcripts tool
           rather than us guessing, so an escalation is a decision with a
           stated reason instead of a heuristic. A transcript runs 6,000 to
           9,000 words, which is why this is not simply always on.

How often stage 2 fires is the escalation rate, modeled at 15% in
HOME-STRETCH.md and never measured. Every session writes a line to
assistant.log saying whether it escalated and what it cost, because that
number is what Pro's margin moves with and a guess is not good enough to
price on.

The model is Sonnet 5 (config.ASSISTANT_MODEL), not Opus. That is a costing
decision, not a shrug: see the note on the constant.
