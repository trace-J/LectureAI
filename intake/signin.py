"""The gate in front of the panel, when it is reached from somewhere else.

The panel listens on this Mac only. One road leads to it from elsewhere:
the account service's relay (relay.py), where the service itself is the
sign-in and names the viewer in every request. This module is the gate.
Requests from this Mac are never gated, so http://127.0.0.1:5173 keeps
working whatever the relay is doing.

Who may enter is decided by the Syllabus account this Mac is signed in to
(account.py): its owner, and nobody else. The service decides that before
it relays anything, and names the viewer in the frame; the panel checks
that the name still matches the account this Mac holds, and trusts nothing
else.

The panel has no sign-in of its own any more. Until 2026-09-14 it ran
Google's sign-in itself against an allowlist in .env; until 2026-09-15 it
ran a sign-in through the account service for anyone arriving over a
Cloudflare Tunnel, with a session in a signed cookie. The tunnel, its
hostname, and its PANEL_PUBLIC_URL and PANEL_SECRET_KEY settings were
retired on 2026-09-15, and that code went with them.
