"""Permission to record: asked once per profile, before the first recording.

Recording a lecture or a call without the permission of the people in it can
break a school's policy or the law where it happens. Before this Mac records
anything, the person using it confirms, once, that they have that permission.
The answer is kept in the profile's home as consent.json, stamped with when it
was given, from where, and by which version, so it is asked once per profile
and not before every recording.

The gate itself is in record.Recorder.start, the one place every recording
begins (the CLI, the panel's record button, the menu bar item and the panel on
the web all end up there), so no front end can forget to ask. The front ends
check it early as well, only to say so more helpfully.

VERSION is the version of the statement. Changing what the person agrees to
means raising it, which asks everyone again; an older acknowledgment does not
cover words it never showed.
