"""The `intake` command: one entry point over every module.

    intake setup            first run: keys, microphone, schedule
    intake doctor           check the install and say how to fix it
    intake record           record from this Mac's microphone
    intake watch            process the inbox until Ctrl-C
    intake watch --once F   process one file and exit
    intake panel            the control panel, and setup, in your browser
    intake service install  keep the panel running: now, and at every login
    intake service status   is that agent running
    intake login            authorize Google Drive
    intake notion --check   what the Notion integration sees
    intake notion --setup   add the Notion properties it needs
    intake --profile sous   any of the above, against the sous profile

Every subcommand hands its remaining arguments to the module it wraps, so
`intake record --minutes 80` is the same as `python record.py --minutes 80`
from a checkout.

Which profile runs is decided here, before config loads: the --profile flag,
then $INTAKE_PROFILE, then syllabus. The `syllabus` and `sous` commands are
this same entry point with the profile chosen, so `sous record` is
`intake --profile sous record`.
