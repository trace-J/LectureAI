"""Transcription providers: a model, and the limits that belong to it.

The chunking rules are not properties of audio. They are properties of the
model on the other end of the call:

- `max_bytes` is the API's request cap. OpenAI rejects anything over 25MB;
  Deepgram takes 2GB.
- `max_chunk_seconds` exists because the gpt-4o transcribe models cap their
  OUTPUT near 2000 tokens and truncate silently rather than erroring, so long
  audio has to be split on duration as well as size. Whisper has no such cap,
  and Deepgram has no duration limit worth naming.
- `truncation_word_threshold` is the tell for that silent truncation. A model
  that cannot truncate sets it to None and the check is skipped entirely.

Keeping these next to the model means swapping the model swaps its limits with
it. Before this module they lived in config.py as bare constants, and setting
TRANSCRIBE_MODEL = "whisper-1" left CHUNK_SECONDS at 8 minutes: two and a half
times the API calls that model needs, at no benefit.

The config constants are still the source of the default provider's values, so
a value changed there still changes what the default provider does.

Adding a provider: subclass nothing, implement the protocol, register it in
PROVIDERS. transcribe.py asks the provider for its limits and never reads a
config constant.
