"""The panel on the web, through the account service, with nothing to set up.

Once this Mac is signed in to a Syllabus account (account.py), its panel has
an address on the account service:

    https://syllabusaccounts.maincoursemedia.com/p/<device>/

This module is how requests to that address reach the panel. The panel
opens a WebSocket to the service, authenticated with its device token, and
keeps it open from a thread inside the panel process. The service holds the
other end and sends each browser request down it as a JSON frame; the frame
is run against the Flask app right here, in process, and the answer goes
back up the socket. No port is opened, nothing is installed, no hostname or
tunnel is configured.

    to us        {t:"req", id, method, path, query, headers, viewer:{email, account_id}, base, body}
    from us      {t:"res", id, status, headers, body, more?}   then   {t:"chunk", id, body, more?}
                 {t:"hello", name, version}   once, when the socket opens
    to us        {t:"welcome", device, chunk_bytes, max_response_bytes, timeout_ms}

Bodies are base64. A message may not exceed 1 MiB on the service's side,
so a long answer is split at the chunk size the welcome frame names.

Trust runs in one direction. The service decides who may reach the address
(only the account's owner) and names the viewer in every frame. The panel
believes it because the frame arrived on a socket the panel itself opened
with its own token, and marks the request with WSGI environ keys that no
network request can set (signin.py reads them). Cookies, Cf-* and
X-Forwarded-* headers are never carried over, so the tunnel's gate cannot
be confused by a relayed request either.

The socket reconnects on its own with a growing pause, and nothing here runs
at all without an account: a panel with no account.json is exactly what it
was. The Setup page and `intake doctor` read status() for what is going on.
