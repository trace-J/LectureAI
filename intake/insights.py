"""What the panel's dashboard is drawn from: pipeline.log read against the schedule.

Nothing here is stored. The log and the schedule are the only inputs, so the
tiles and charts cannot drift from what was actually filed, and a line
removed from the log disappears from the charts on the next poll.

Two things the log knows that the panel did not use before:

- The stem of a filed lecture starts with the course and the class date
  (ACCT-4321_2026-09-10_Job-Order-Costing). That date is the lecture's; the
  line's own timestamp is only when processing finished, which for a
  recording synced from a phone can be days later.
- A seventh field, added in September 2026, carries a small JSON object of
  measurements: seconds of audio, words in the transcript, to-dos and key
  terms found. Lines without it are read as before and count as lectures
  with nothing measured.
