"""Runs the panel's own page scripts against a real DOM.

Every other suite here tests Python. These two pages are most of what the
user actually touches, and nothing in this repo could execute a line of
them: five of the defects a 2026-09-16 audit found lived entirely in
template JavaScript and went straight through a fully green suite, because
the only thing testing them was substring assertions on the served HTML.

This renders the pages through Flask, exactly as a browser receives them,
then hands them to node, which loads them into jsdom and runs their own
scripts. The assertions live in tests/panel/panel.test.mjs. From the
project root:

    .venv/bin/python test_panel.py

It needs node and one pinned package:

    npm ci --prefix tests/panel

Without those it says so and stops, rather than passing quietly. CI sets
SYLLABUS_REQUIRE_JS_TESTS=1, which turns a missing toolchain into a failure
rather than a skip: a harness that skips itself in CI is the thing it was
built to replace.
