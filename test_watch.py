"""Tests for watch.process(), the orchestrator that turns one recording into
filed notes.

Nothing here reaches a network, a provider, or Google Drive: transcription,
summarization and the upload are replaced with fakes that record what they
were asked to do. The files are real, inside a throwaway $INTAKE_HOME. From
the project root:

    .venv/bin/python test_watch.py

process() had no coverage at all before this file, which is how a handful of
defects in it went unnoticed by a green suite. It is the one place a lecture
can be lost, paid for twice, or filed under the wrong class, so the fakes
below count calls as well as returning values: several of the things worth
asserting here are about how often an expensive step runs, not about what it
returns.
